# youtube-clone

A YouTube clone i made. Git deleted the original version so i just made another one. However it might not be as good as the original version though so far everything seems good. I made this to practice html and css. In future i might make it more functional but there's not much functionality in the current version. It's fun and relaxing to code frontend.
